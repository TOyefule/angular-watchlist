# Stock Watchlist

This is a little thing I put together in about an hour while continuing to learn AngularJS. It provides the ability to add a list of stocks to a Watchlist, then select individual stocks to view an interactive chart of the stock's recent performance. Additionally, in browsers where it is available, changes you make to the Watchilst (adding and removing stocks) are saved using `localStorage` and thus will remain the next time you visit the page.

Live demo is [available here](http://zacharytamas.com/playground/watchlist/).
